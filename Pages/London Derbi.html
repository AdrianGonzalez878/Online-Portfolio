            <p>The Arsenal F.C.–Chelsea F.C. rivalry is a rivalry between London-based professional association football clubs Arsenal Football Club and Chelsea Football Club. Arsenal play their home games at the Emirates Stadium, while Chelsea play their home games at Stamford Bridge.
                Overall, Arsenal have won more games in the rivalry's history, having won 81 times to Chelsea's 66, with 59 draws (as of 6 November 2022).[2] Arsenal's record win was a 5–1 victory in a First Division match at Stamford Bridge on 29 November 1930. Chelsea's record win was a 6–0 victory at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League on 22 March 2014. Didier Drogba holds the mark for the most derby goals with 13 in all competitions.[3]
                The clubs have contested five major finals: the 2002 FA Cup Final, which Arsenal won 2–0, the 2007 League Cup Final, which Chelsea won 2–1, the 2017 FA Cup Final, which Arsenal won 2–1, the 2019 Europa League Final, which Chelsea won 4–1, and the 2020 FA Cup Final, which Arsenal won 2–1.</p>

            <p>While they never considered each other primary rivals, as two of the biggest and most successful clubs in London there has always been strong needle between the fans dating back to the 1930s. Matches between them would often attract large attendances.

                The Arsenal and Chelsea rivalry has been more recently considered an important derby, after Chelsea's rise to the top class of the Premier League in the 2000s, when the two started to compete constantly for the Premier League title.
                
                According to an internet survey of fans in December 2003, the Arsenal fans who responded to the survey said that they considered Chelsea as their third rival, after Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.[4]
                
                Those Chelsea fans who responded to the survey said that they considered Arsenal as their main rival, however Tottenham and Fulham are their more traditional rivals.[4]
                
                In a 2008 survey by the Football Fans Census, Arsenal fans named Chelsea as the club they disliked the most, ahead of their traditional rivals Tottenham. Chelsea fans named Arsenal as their second most-disliked club, behind Liverpool.[5] A 2014 Bleacher Report article ranks Arsenal as Chelsea's second-most hated rival.</p>
