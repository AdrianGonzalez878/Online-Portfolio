        <h2>Client</h2>
        <p><strong>ShopEase</strong> &ndash; A mid-sized e-commerce company struggling with high cart abandonment rates and inconsistent user engagement on their website.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>

            <li>The checkout process was cumbersome, resulting in a cart abandonment rate of 65%.</li>
    
        <p>ShopEase wanted to revamp its front-end experience to improve user engagement, optimize the checkout process, and create a fully responsive design.</p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        
            <li>Redesign the website to make it fully responsive across all devices.</li>
