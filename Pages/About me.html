            <p>Hi, I’m Adrian </p>

               <p> A web development enthusiast with a passion for creating user-friendly websites and solving real-world problems through technology. My journey started with designing websites for friends and small businesses, where I discovered the joy of turning ideas into functional and visually appealing digital experiences.

                Currently, I’m a student in the web development program at Seattle Central College, where I’m deepening my expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and beyond. My background also includes working in bilingual customer service, where I honed my communication skills and developed a knack for understanding diverse customer needs.
                
                What excites me most is the challenge of crafting solutions that make life easier for people—whether it’s streamlining a user’s online experience or helping businesses grow through better web presence. I’m always looking for opportunities to learn, collaborate, and put my skills to work solving meaningful problems.
                
                When I’m not coding, you can find me shooting hoops on the basketball court or spending time with friends.
                
                Let’s connect and talk about how I can bring value to your team!</p>
